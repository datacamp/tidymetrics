Dimensional modeling done the tidy way!

## Installation

You can install the released version of tidymetrics from the development version from GitHub with:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("datacamp/tidymetrics")
```

## What the package contains

The "cross by" family of functions, which prepare data to be aggregated in ways useful for dimensional modeling:

* `cross_by_periods`, which prepares data with a `date` column to be aggregated by calendar periods (day/week/month), rolling windows, or "X weeks ago"
* `cross_by_dimensions`, which adds an `All` level to each segment

Methods for annotating aggregated metrics with useful metadata:

* `create_metrics`, which gathers a table of metrics into a list of `tbl_metric` objects and attaches metadata to it
* `create_metric_group`, which annotates a group of metrics with the same dimensions as a `tbl_metric_group`

Verbs for working with dimensions in metric tables, including:

* `discard_dimensions` (and its inverse `keep_dimensions`), which filters for only the `All` segment of dimensions and removes those columns
* `condense_metric`, which retains only observations with one non-All dimension (in order to store a compact version that can still be explored one dimension at a time)
